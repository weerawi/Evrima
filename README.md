                            INTELLIGENT SEARCH ENGINE TO FIND BEST PRODUCTS ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS.


Aim of our project is to create an intelligent search engine that is capable of effectively selecting the best products across multiple e- commerce 
websites in a time that there are lots of online shopping platforms.The motivation for this project is because we realized that consumers face a big
problem when selecting products in online e-commerce platforms because there are lots of websites that can be confusing when online shopping.

Project objectives:
        •	Develop an Intelligent Search Algorithm
        •	Data Aggregation and Integration
        •	User-Friendly Interface
        •	Cross-Platform Compatibility

Scope of the project:
This title's scope is much bigger. Therefore, within the development period, our scope is to concentrate on computer components because many 
products and categories on an e-commerce website will require complex demo development. After we develop a demo version, we will increase our 
scope based on our project's progress. Because we are currently dealing with the world's largest online selling websites. 

Limitations:

        •	We have to limit to the three main platforms daraz ,amazon and ebay
        •	There are some products without reviews and ratings.
        •	We must consider limited number of product categories.
        •	Provided APIs did not provide data that’s the way we want.
        

Methods or tools that could be used in your solution:

  Methods:
        •	Machine learning algorithms.
        •	Natural language processing (NLP).
        •	Data mining techniques

  Tools:
        •	Web Scraping Tools.
        •	Database Management.
        •	Machine Learning and NLP Libraries.
        •	Front-End Development Tools.
        •	Back-End Development Tools.
        •	API Frameworks-RESTful APIs to communicate between the front-end and back-end systems.
        
        
  Technologies used:
        •	Programming languages: Python is popular programming languages for developing search engines.
        •	Web Framework: We need a web framework to build back-end components of your search engine. We use Flask. Flask is a lightweight Python
          web framework suitable for building RESTful API.
        •	Database Management System: To store and manage product data and user interactions, we need a database system. So, we use SQLite, A 
          lightweight file-based database suitable for small to medium-sized applications and MySQL, A popular open-source relational database management system.
        •	Version Control: Use a version control system like Git for collaborative development and code management.

Conclusions

Based on these challenges, we have concluded that it is not possible to rank products across multiple platforms using only external data from 
e-commerce platforms. If we want to create a platform that ranks products across multiple platforms, we will need to monitor sellers individually
and prove their honesty.
One way to do this would be to require sellers to provide us with detailed information about their products, including product specifications, 
pricing, and reviews. Then we use this information to create your own internal ranking algorithm. We could also use this information to identify 
and remove fake reviews.
Another way to monitor sellers would be to use AI to analyze their sales data and customer feedback. This could help you to identify any sellers 
who are engaging in fake revies and ratings.
By monitoring sellers individually and proving their honesty, we can create a platform that ranks products across multiple platforms in a 
accurate way.
